Clearly in this case parallelising the computation did not result in any efficiency, it is likely that the quantity of data that had to be returned was not large enough to justify the use of parallel computing, this idea is explored below.\nBelow are serial and parallel bootstraps of 1000 samples at a time, each of size 1000.\n\n#1 00 bootstrap samples of 1000 at a time \n\n\n#Serial \ntablefy(\n  system.time(\n    result1 &lt;- foreach(i = 1:1000, .combine = c ) %do% {\n      inner &lt;- foreach(j = 1:1000, .combine = c) %do% {\n        res &lt;- sample(gal, replace = TRUE)\n        median(res)\n      }\n      inner\n    }\n  ), \"Serial bootstrap of 1000 samples\" \n)\n\n\nSerial bootstrap of 1000 samples\n\n\nUser time\nSystem Time\nTotal elapsed\n\n\n\n\n65.466\n0.619\n66.403\n\n\n\n\n#Parallel\n\ncl &lt;- makeCluster(10)\nregisterDoParallel(cl)\n\ntablefy(system.time(\n  result2 &lt;- foreach(i = 1:1000, .combine = rbind, .packages = 'foreach' ) %dopar% {\n    inner &lt;- foreach(j = 1:1000, .combine = c, .packages = 'foreach') %dopar% {\n    res &lt;- sample(gal, replace = TRUE)\n    median(res)\n    }\n    return(inner)\n  }\n), \"Parallel bootstrap of 1000 samples\"\n)\n\n\nParallel bootstrap of 1000 samples\n\n\nUser time\nSystem Time\nTotal elapsed\n\n\n\n\n0.269\n0.1\n12.021\n\n\n\n\nstopCluster(cl)\n\nClearly the use of parallel computing resulting in a much faster computation and leads one ot believe that it would provide efficiency in a situation where the quantity of data that needs to be returned is large.\n\n\n5 Question 3\nBelow we estimate the coverage of a percentile bootstrap confidence interval for samples of size 50 from an exponential distribution of mean 1.\nThis will be implemented by generating 500 samples of size 10000 from the exponential distribution with mean 1. For each of these samples a 500 bootstrapped mean estimates will be sampled. For each of the 500 samples a 95% percentile bootstrap confidence interval of the mean will be generated. It will be thereafter be recorded as to whether 1 lies inside each of these intervals, the proportion of intervals than contain 1 will be the estimated coverage\nThe result is shown below.\n\ncl &lt;- makeCluster(10)\nregisterDoParallel(cl)\n\n\n#Generate exponential sample \n\n\ninCi &lt;- foreach(i = 1:500, .combine = c, .packages = 'foreach') %dopar%{\n  smpl_init &lt;- rexp(10000, rate = 1)\n  means &lt;- foreach(i = 1:500, .combine = c, .packages = 'foreach') %dopar% {\n    bsampls &lt;- sample(smpl_init, replace = T)\n    return(mean(bsampls))\n  }\n  \n  quants &lt;- quantile(means, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))\n  \n  return(((quants[1] &lt;= 1) && (quants[2] &gt;= 1)))\n}\n\npaste0(mean(inCi)*100, \"%\") |&gt; \n  knitr::kable(col.names = \"Estimated Coverage\")\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Coverage\n\n\n\n\n93.4%\n\n\n\n\nstopCluster(cl)\n\nThe estimated coverage is 95.2%, this is not a surprising figure as each bootstrap percentile confidence interval is a 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n6 Question 4\nBelow is a serial iteration over 3 vectors each containing 5 random variables and finds the max of those vectors.
